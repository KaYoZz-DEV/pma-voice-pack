# pma-voice-pack
Here is the pma-voice pack with the script + the associated radio.
To modify the key to talk on the radio or to modify the distance of voic, it is necessary to go in the configuration of the keys directly on GTA, then in the categories FIVEM.

Script designed by https://github.com/AvarianKnight and modified by me, for compatibility.
